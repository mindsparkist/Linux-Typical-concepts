There are a couple of ways to check if you have sudo access on Ubuntu:

**1. Try running a command with sudo:**

The most straightforward way is to try running a command that requires root privileges with sudo. If you have sudo access, it will prompt you for your password and then execute the command. If you don't have sudo access, you'll see an error message like "Sorry, user [your_username] may not run sudo on this machine."

**2. Check group membership:**

On Ubuntu, users with sudo access typically belong to the "sudo" group. You can check your group membership using the `groups` command. If the output includes "sudo", then you likely have sudo access.

Here's the command:

```
groups
```

**Important note:**  While checking group membership can be a clue, it's not definitive proof of sudo access.  A user could be in the "sudo" group but not have actual sudo privileges due to the configuration in the sudoers file.

**Caution:** Editing the `/etc/sudoers` file directly is not recommended as it can lead to security vulnerabilities if done incorrectly. If you need to grant sudo access to a user, it's best to consult the Ubuntu documentation or seek help from a system administrator.

The methods for checking sudo access in RHEL are similar to Ubuntu, but with a slight difference:

**1. Try running a command with sudo:**

As in Ubuntu, attempt to run a command that requires root privileges with sudo. If you have sudo access, it will prompt for your password and execute the command. Otherwise, you'll see an error message like `"Sorry, user [your_username] may not run sudo on this machine."`

**2. Check group membership:**

In RHEL, users with sudo access also belong to the "sudo" group. You can verify your group membership using the `groups` command. If the output includes "sudo", then you likely have sudo access.

Here's the command:

```
groups
```

**Important note:** Similar to Ubuntu, being in the "sudo" group is an indicator but not a guarantee of sudo access. The sudoers file ultimately determines user privileges.

**Additional method (RHEL-specific):**

*RHEL provides a way to check sudo privileges without actually running a command.* You can use the `sudo -l` flag to list your allowed sudo privileges. However, this method might have security restrictions:

```
sudo -l
```

If you have sudo access, it will display the commands you're authorized to run with sudo. If you don't have access or the security policy disallows it, you'll see an error message like `"User [your_username] is not allowed to run sudo on [hostname]"`

**Caution:** Editing the `/etc/sudoers` file directly to grant sudo access is not recommended due to potential security risks. Consult the RHEL documentation or seek help from a system administrator for proper user permission management.
